            text="I am currently learning web development to build projects (with a nice ui and ux) while hopping on the hype of problem-solving in competitive programming and math. I enjoy customizing my Linux operating system, specifically NixOS with Hyprland. I love giving presentations and organizing events like hackathons or even to-do lists. Meeting new people, sharing, and discussing different topics brings me joy. In my free time, I enjoy looking up and comparing computer hardware, modding keyboards, watching Formula One on weekends, and cooking + enjoying delicious meals."
